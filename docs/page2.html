				This was an interesting topic to research becasue, as compared to
				other high-income countries, United States of America has a
				relatively high rate of police killings. It averages around 1000
				killings per year. Recently, unethical police killings have been all
				over the news and it has given rise to revolutionary movements such
				as BLM. The analysis in this paper has been mainly drawn from a
				police shooting database which has information such as race, age,
				name, city, state of the person shot by police and some other
				details. This paper is trying to figure the correlation between
				these shootings and the factors that affect these police shootings.
				According to that, we have isolated 4 different categories that
				gives us some clarification about these shootings and it also helps
				us analyze the trends in the dataset and draw conclusions from it.
				<br><br>
				California, Texas and Florida were the top 3 states in terms
				of number of police shootings in 5 years. In order to learn more
				about the number of shootings per city in these states, click on the
				bar graph.

				US police murder rates are higher than in other developed countries.
				<br />It is 4 times the rate in Canada, 22 times the rate in
				Australia, 40 times the rate in Germany, and 125 times the rate in
				England. Therefore, this makes it more important to investigate the
				dataset and figure out what trends are observed in these shootings.
				To start off, the dataset was divided into 5 different ethnicities
				which considers White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Natives and others.
				The dataset ranges from January, 2015 to June, 2020. On first
				glance, it shows that in these 5 years, white people account for
				50.58% of police shootings, while Black, Hispanic, Asian and
				Native people account for 26.51%, 18.42%, 1.8%, and 1.59% of
				shootings respectively. Howsoever, we need to take into account the
				proportion of white population compared to these racial groups when
				evaluation these statistics. Therefore, this paper takes into
				account 4 different categories to analyze the dataset and relate it
				to the number of shootings in a state. Those categories are:-
				<ul>
					<li>Relating per capita income of a state.</li>
					<li>Relating police funding of a state.</li>
					<li>Considering the gun laws of a state.</li>
					<li>
						Considering age, gender, and race of a person to analyze the
						trends.
					</li>
				</ul>
